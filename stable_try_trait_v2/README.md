# stable_try_trait_v2

A simple stable implementation of the `Try`, `FromResidual`, and `Residual` traits under the `try_trait_v2` feature. (tracking issue [#84277](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/84277))

A `try_!()` macro is also provided, which helps replace the `?` operator.

The major and minor version of this crate is the same as the version of stable rust that it maintains parity with.
